# GhostLogin 🔐
**Automated SSH Exposure and Access Validation Tool**

GhostLogin is an automated cybersecurity tool designed to assess SSH exposure in network ranges, validate access controls, and perform controlled post-access verification in a fully automated, non-interactive manner.

This project was developed as part of the **NX201 Cybersecurity Program**.
